# What is this

This is kinda one of my Aimbot Script and you can say its going to be similar to Aimbot-V3 but its made in mind for linux and also windows

## Were will you start first

I will start first with the linux libs for capturing apps rendering content in a fast and python compatible way and then will add support for X11 (the linux desktop enviroment) and windows users
